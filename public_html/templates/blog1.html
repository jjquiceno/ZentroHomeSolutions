    <h1>The Hidden Costs of Selling a Home vs. Wholesaling</h1>
    <p>For many homeowners looking to sell, the true costs of a traditional home sale can come as a surprise.
        Between repairs, realtor commissions, and seller closing costs, the expenses quickly add up.
        Wholesaling, on the other hand, offers a faster and often more affordable alternative for those who
        need to sell quickly without draining their finances.</p>

    <h2>1. Repair & Renovation Costs</h2>
    <p>In a traditional sale, homeowners are often expected to make costly repairs or updates before listing.
        This might include fixing structural issues, repainting, upgrading flooring, or remodeling kitchens and
        bathrooms. These improvements can cost anywhere from a few thousand dollars to tens of thousands,
        depending on the condition of the property. Wholesaling eliminates the need for these expenses, as
        wholesalers typically purchase homes in “as-is” condition.</p>

    <h2>2. Realtor Commissions</h2>
    <p>Hiring a real estate agent usually means paying a commission of 5–6% of the home’s selling price. For
        example, on a $300,000 home, commissions alone could be $15,000–$18,000. With wholesaling,
        homeowners bypass realtors entirely, avoiding this hefty fee and keeping more money in their pocket.</p>

    <h2>3. Seller Closing Costs</h2>
    <p>Beyond commissions, sellers are often responsible for additional closing costs such as title fees,
        transfer taxes, and attorney fees. These costs can add another 2–5% of the sale price. With
        wholesaling, these expenses are often minimized or covered by the buyer, offering a simpler and more
        cost-effective solution.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>While a traditional home sale may work for some, it often comes with high upfront expenses that can be
        burdensome. Wholesaling provides a faster, simpler, and more affordable alternative, especially for
        those facing financial strain or looking for a hassle-free transaction. By avoiding repair costs, realtor
        fees, and heavy seller expenses, homeowners can save thousands while moving forward with
        confidence.</p>
